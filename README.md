Shufflix App
Shufflix is building a randomized name and comment selector for giveaways. Their main customers? Streamers, YouTubers, and content creators who want an easy way to engage their audiences. Right now, theyâ€™re still working on their paid product, but they want to generate buzz by offering a free demo on their marketing website.

We're going to help Shufflix finish building out their demo. Another engineer has set it up some code already and has asked you to complete the functions listed in your resource document to finish their demo functionality.
